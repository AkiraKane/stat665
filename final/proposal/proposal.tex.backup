\section{SpamBase Data}

The SpamBase dataset is a publicly available data set from the UCI machine learning
repository. It was originally curated by Hewlett Packard Labs, and contains spam data
from two months in the summer of 1999. The problem is a binary classification problem 
(spam or not-spam). The data contains fifty-five features of continuous word and symbol 
statistics.

\section{Plan for Data Analysis}

Generally in classification problems we wish to minimize the misclassification error
rate. In the development of a spam filter specifically, there is a class of misclassification
errors that is egregious: false positives. Thus, we wish to minimize false positives. 
According to the data set's documentation, a previous analysis that enforced a constraint
of zero false positives had a 25\% misclassification error, which is pretty bad. In this
project, we seek a good balance between misclassification error and number of false positives.

There are several classification methods from lecture that we wish to carry out on the data.
These include: k-NN, LDA, QDA, reduced-rank LDA, and logistic regression. A couple of these
methods may not make sense given that the dimensionality of the data set is not super high.
